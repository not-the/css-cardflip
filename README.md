# CSS Card Flip

https://not-the.github.io/css-cardflip/

Simple CSS-based card flip "animation" (uses transitions instead of animations for simplicity's sake, it should be using an animation to prevent the divs from desyncing but this was just a proof of concept).

The div flips over when hovered to reveal another element.
